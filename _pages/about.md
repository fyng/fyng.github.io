I am a Computational Biology PhD student at Memorial Sloan Kettering. I work on generative models for therapeutic design, advised by [Wesley Tansey](https://wesleytansey.com/). 

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science, where I worked on spatial genomics technology with [Jean Fan](https://jef.works/) and rapid diagnostics with [Alex Trick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alextrickphd/). I also worked on molecular diagnostics for internal hemorrhage and and sedation monitoring in the pediatric ICU.
