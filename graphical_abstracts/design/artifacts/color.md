# Colour

**Colour does one job at a time.** Before picking a colour, name the job. The palette
for that job follows from the tables below. If a mark has no job, it is ink or
context grey.

Reference sheet: `out/specimen-color.png`. The values live in `tokens.mjs`; use the
CSS variables (`var(--harm)`) or `tokens.json`, never raw hex in a figure.

## Foundations

### Neutrals

| Token | Hex | Contrast on paper | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `paper` | `#ffffff` | – | Background. Figures are always light |
| `ink` | `#16181d` | 17.9:1 | Titles, body, primary marks |
| `ink-2` | `#4a4e58` | 8.3:1 | Labels, axes |
| `muted` | `#6b707b` | 5.0:1 | Captions, ticks. **The lightest text colour** |
| `context` | `#a3a8b1` | 2.4:1 | De-emphasised *data* (comparator series, non-hits). Never text |
| `rule` | `#d9dbe0` | – | Hairlines, dividers, gridlines |
| `wash` | `#f4f5f7` | – | Grouping fills; the diverging midpoint |
| `prussian` | `#1f4e79` | 8.7:1 | Structural ink: panel numbers, arrows, method boxes, models |

### Hue ramps

There are eight families (blue, vermilion, teal, ochre, violet, moss, rose, slate),
each with steps 100–900. They are generated in OKLCH at fixed lightness, so
**a step number means the same lightness in every hue**. That lets any hue swap
into a role without re-checking contrast:

| Step | Use |
|---|---|
| 100 | Washes: background of a highlighted box or pill |
| 200–300 | Light end of scales; never marks on their own |
| **500** | **Marks**: bars, lines, dots, icons (≥ 3:1 on paper) |
| **600** | **Text in a hue**: direct labels, accent words (≥ 5:1 on paper) |
| 700–900 | Dark end of scales; 700 is the text step for blue-family benefit |

## Palettes by theme

### 1. Valence: when one outcome is better

For data that carry a judgement: toxicity against response, risk against protection,
resistance against sensitivity.

| Role | Mark | Text | Wash | Means |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Harm** `--harm` | vermilion 500 | vermilion 600 | vermilion 100 | adverse events, risk, toxicity, resistance, worse survival |
| **Benefit** `--benefit` | blue 600 | blue 700 | blue 100 | response, sensitivity, protection, better survival |

- **Why blue, not green, for benefit:** red and green are the pair most confused
  under deuteranopia. Blue against vermilion stays opposite for every reader.
- A figure about safety makes *harm* the focus; a figure about efficacy makes
  *benefit* the focus. The other side (or a null result) is context grey.
- Don't use valence for things that are merely "up" or "down"; see *Direction*.

### 2. Emphasis: the one thing to look at

| Role | Value | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Accent** `--accent` | vermilion 500 (text 600) | One accent per figure: the finding's key phrase and its mark |
| **Context** `--context` | grey `#a3a8b1` | Everything the accent is compared against |

- **The accent takes the valence of the finding.** In a harm story it is vermilion,
  which is the default. In a benefit story, redefine it for that figure:
  `--accent: var(--benefit)`, `--accent-text: var(--benefit-text)`. Otherwise one
  vermilion finding would read as harm.
- **Focus + context beats a rainbow.** When the story is one series against the
  rest, colour one and grey the rest instead of assigning categorical hues.

### 3. Identity: which thing is which

For categories with no order or judgement, such as tissues, cell types, cohorts or
model systems.

| Slot | Hue | Mark | Text step |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | blue | `#2268ba` | `#2268ba` |
| 2 | ochre | `#b07b06` | `#8b6001` |
| 3 | teal | `#099a94` | `#047974` |
| 4 | vermilion | `#d85737` | `#b43818` |
| 5 | violet | `#9b6bce` | `#7d4eab` |
| 6 | moss | `#629742` | `#477825` |
| 7 | rose | `#c95a8b` | `#a63d6d` |

- **Assign in order, never cycle.** Series *n* gets slot *n*. An 8th category folds
  into "other" (context grey), or the chart becomes small multiples.
- **Don't mix identity with valence** in one panel. A chart that uses harm and
  benefit does not also use categorical slots.
- **Colour follows the entity, not its rank.** Filtering or re-sorting never
  repaints survivors.
- **Up to three categories can touch anywhere** (scatter, maps, spatial plots):
  slots 1–3 are distinct in every pairing. With more, add direct labels or shapes,
  or facet.

### 4. Entities: colour that persists across figures

Some things appear in many figures and keep one colour everywhere. They are
registered in `tokens.mjs` (`entity`) and exposed as `--organ-lungs` and so on.

| Organ | Colour | Organ | Colour |
|---|---|---|---|
| lungs | blue 600 | thyroid | violet 500 |
| liver | ochre 500 | kidney | moss 500 |
| colon | teal 500 | skin | rose 500 |
| adrenal | vermilion 500 | | |

Register new recurring entities (lesion classes, model systems, cell types) before
their first use, and draw them from the categorical hues. A registered colour beats
slot order. If two registered entities that are close in hue sit side by side,
label them directly.

#### Cell types: a family palette

Cell types in one figure are members of one kind, so they share one hue band,
blue through violet to magenta, instead of taking categorical slots. They read as
related and distinct at once.

| Token | Mark | Tint (`-wash`) | OKLCH |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--cell-1` | `#3e45a2` indigo | `#a8b1da` | 0.44 0.148 275 |
| `--cell-2` | `#5c87ec` cornflower | `#b8ccf7` | 0.64 0.159 265 |
| `--cell-3` | `#b855a6` orchid | `#e2b8d8` | 0.60 0.160 335 |
| `--cell-4` | `#721f65` plum | `#c7a2bd` | 0.40 0.142 335 |

- The four were chosen by search over the 265–335° band, for the widest separation
  under colour-vision deficiency with every mark at least 3:1 on paper. Every pair
  is at least 10.7 apart under protanopia and deuteranopia, and at least 15 apart
  for normal vision.
- The mark colour is for nuclei, outlines, dial wedges and matrix fills. The tint
  (62 % toward paper, 40 % chroma) is for cytoplasm and other large fills.
- **Four is the limit.** With more cell types, fold the rest into "other" (context
  grey) or split into small multiples. A panel never uses the family palette and the
  categorical slots together.
- Defined in `tokens.mjs` (`family.cell`).

### 5. Magnitude: how much

One hue, light to dark.

| Scale | Ramp | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Quantity** (default) | teal 100 → 900 | Expression, counts, density, anything without a judgement |
| **Harm** | vermilion 100 → 900 | Risk, toxicity grade, predicted probability of harm |
| **Benefit** | blue 100 → 900 | Response rate, sensitivity |

- Continuous fields (heatmaps, spatial maps) use the full 100–900. Discrete ordered
  classes (grades 1–4, tiers) use steps 400–800, so the lightest class is still
  ≥ 2:1 on paper. Order must be visible in the colour.
- **Dense images** (e.g. per-pixel spatial expression) may use *cividis*, the one
  multi-hue exception, because it is perceptually uniform and CVD-safe.
  Use no other rainbow or jet maps.
- Always show a key with labelled ends.

### 6. Direction: which way, without judging

For signed quantities where neither side is better: log fold change, bias, embedding
axes, up- and down-regulation.

| Scale | Negative arm | Midpoint | Positive arm |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Valence** (see §1) | blue (benefit) | `wash` | vermilion (harm) |
| **Direction** | violet | `wash` | ochre |

- The midpoint is always a neutral grey that means zero.
- Arms are symmetric, with equal steps each side, from 200 to 800.
- Violet and ochre are chosen because they are warm and cool, CVD-safe, and carry no
  "good" or "bad" meaning. Use them for volcano plots, fold-change heatmaps and
  cell-line bias.

### 7. Structure: the figure itself

Structure is not data, so it takes no data colours.

- **Arrows and flow:** prussian, 2.5 px.
- **Method boxes** (LLM, model, pipeline step): benefit-wash fill, 12 px corners, a
  prussian icon above a short prussian label. Never a solid dark block.
- **Dividers, axes and gridlines:** `rule` and `ink-2` hairlines.
- **Pills and tags:** a wash fill with the matching `*-text` colour.

## Validation

Validation is computed, not eyeballed. It uses OKLab ΔE (×100) under the
Machado–Oliveira–Fernandes 2009 protanopia and deuteranopia simulation, plus WCAG
contrast against `paper`.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Categorical, adjacent pairs: CVD ΔE (target ≥ 8) | **8.7** worst (rose–moss) |
| Categorical, adjacent pairs: normal-vision ΔE (floor 15) | **19.4** worst |
| Slots 1–3, all pairs: CVD ΔE | **14.4** worst |
| All 500 marks vs paper | ≥ 3:1 |
| All 600 text steps vs paper | ≥ 5:1 (4.5:1 needed) |
| Ordinal ramps 400–800 | monotone lightness, adjacent ΔL ≥ 0.06, light end ≥ 2:1 |

**How the order was chosen:** all 720 orderings that open on blue were enumerated.
Among those passing every gate, we kept the one with the widest all-pairs separation
for the first three slots. That is blue, ochre, teal, which suits the two- or
three-group comparisons typical of our figures. It also keeps vermilion out of the
first three, so harm-red doesn't turn up by accident in a neutral comparison.

**If you change a hue:** edit `tokens.mjs`, regenerate, and re-run a CVD validator
(any OKLab/Machado implementation) on the categorical order and the ordinal ramps
before using it.

## What Lamina deliberately is not

It avoids the conventions of other visual systems: no coloured background panels
behind charts, no thick white gridlines, no red brand bar or tab, no single brand hue
applied to every series. Colour here always follows the data's meaning.
